# greencat

A port of [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) to Dart, including [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk). API and conventions are
preserved as much as possible and only changed to idiomatic Dart. This is work in
progress and might introduce backward incompatible changes, though it is avoided.

## Usage

Examples of usage are provided with [AngularDart 2](https://github.com/dart-lang/angular2) and [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).

## Features and bugs

Please file feature requests and bugs at the [issue tracker][tracker].
